This project is a Data Engineering bootcamp created by [42 AI](http://www.42ai.fr).

A prior Python programming experience is required (the Python bootcamp)! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come and learn some of the essential knowledge for Data Engineering, in a single week. You will start with SQL and NoSQL languages and then get acquainted with some useful tools/frameworks for Data Engineering like Airflow, AWS and Spark.

42 Artificial Intelligence is a student organization of the Paris campus of the school 42. Our purpose is to foster discussion, learning, and interest in the field of artificial intelligence, by organizing various activities such as lectures and workshops.
