# Bootcamp Data Engineering

# Day02 - AWS - Flask - Terraform

Today, you will learn how to use Amazon Web Services. It has become the most popular cloud service provider in the world followed by Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft's Azure.

Amazon Web Services started in 2005 and it now delivers nearly 2000 services. Due to the large number of services and the maturity of AWS, it is a better option to start learning cloud computing.

If you never heard about the Cloud before, do not worry! You will learn step by step what the Cloud is and how to use it.

## Notions of the day

Create an AWS account, set up a billing alarm.

The day will be divided into two parts. In the first one, you will learn to use a tool called Terraform which will allow you to deploy/destruct an AWS infrastructure. In the second part of the day, you will learn to use a software development kit (SDK) which will allow you to use Python in order to interact with AWS.
