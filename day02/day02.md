# Bootcamp Data Engineering

# Day02 - Cloud Storage API

Today, you will learn how to use a Cloud Provider. For all the exercises, I took Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an example but **you are totally free to use the cloud provider you want which is compatible with Terraform** (we advise you to use AWS if you don't have one). AWS has become the most popular cloud service provider in the world followed by Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure.

Amazon Web Services started in 2005 and it now delivers nearly 2000 services. Due to the large number of services and the maturity of AWS, it is a better option to start learning cloud computing.

If you never heard about the Cloud before, do not worry! You will learn step by step what the Cloud is and how to use it.

## Notions of the day

The day will be divided into two parts. In the first one, you will learn to use a tool called Terraform which will allow you to deploy/destruct cloud infrastructures. In the second part of the day, you will learn to use a software development kit (SDK) which will allow you to use Python in order to interact with your cloud.

## General rules

* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask any question in the dedicated channel in Slack: **[42ai slack](https://42-ai.slack.com)**.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  **[Github issues](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues)**.
