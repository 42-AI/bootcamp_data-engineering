Before getting into AWS infrastructure, we are going to discover how to interact with AWS resources using a Python SDK (Software Development Kit) called boto3.

In order to do that, we are going to work with a python microframework called Flask to create an API (a programmatic interface) to interact with a s3 bucket. Flask will run a service within our EC2 instance and with which we will be able to interact (through the instance ip and a specific port). In order to interact with an AWS resource we have to grant certain permissions to the EC2 we previously created. The most secure way to do that is to use a role and to associate it with the EC2. Roles will grant the needed privileges when associated to a resource.

nb: for a simplification of the following exercises we are going to use Flask directly like a development environment. If we wanted a more production ready application we would add a webserver like nginx and gunicorn.

## Exercise

In your AWS console:

- create an IAM EC2 role to allow S3FullAccess called `s3_access`.
- associate the created role to your EC2 instance.
- change security groups within your EC2 instance to allow traffic from port 5000 (this port will be used by Flask). You can either choose the whole internet or your ip as a source.

In your EC2 instance:

- install `python3` and the librairies `flask` and `boto3` (within python3)
- create a script app.py with 2 routes : 
    - '/'
        - status : '200'
        - messsage : "Succesfully connected to day02 upload/download API"
    - '/list_files' :
        - status : '200'
        - messsage : "Succesfully listed files on s3 bucket '\<bucket_name\>'"
        - content : list of files within the s3 bucket

The content you return with your Flask API has to be json formatted. You should use boto3 to interact with the s3 bucket you previously (`day02-...`).

## Examples

For the route '/'

![Flask root](../assets/curl_root.png){width=600px}

For the route '/list_files'

![Flask list files](../assets/curl_list_files.png){width=600px}
