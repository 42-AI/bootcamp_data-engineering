A little more of full-text search:

Two games speak of a Vibrant World and have a link to facebook.com (or fb.com) in their description. Find them!

Hint: the distance between the word "vibrant" and "world" longer than a few words...

BONUS: there are three games, special Kudos if you find the 3rd one!
