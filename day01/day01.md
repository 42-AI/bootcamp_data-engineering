# Day01 - NoSQL with Elasticsearch

Today, you will learn how to use a NoSQL database: Elasticsearch.
Wait.. Elasticsearch is a database ? Well not exactly it is more than that. It is defined as a search and analytics engine. But let's keep it simple for now, consider it as a database, we will see the rest later.

## Notions of the day

Create an Elasticsearch cluster, create index and mappings, ingest document, search & aggregate, create visual with Kibana

## General rules

* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  <href src="https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues"><u><font color=blue>https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues</font></u></href>.

## Foreword

Did you know that Elasticsearch helps you find your soulmate (or ONS...) ?
<p>
With more than 26 million swipes daily, Tinder connects more people one-on-one and in real time than any other mobile app in the world. Behind the minimalist UI and elegant “swipe right, swipe left” that Tinder pioneered are tremendous challenges of data science, machine learning, and global scalability.

Hear how Tinder relies on the Elastic Stack to analyze, visualize, and predict not only a) which people a user will swipe right on, or b) which people will swipe right on that user, but c) when there’s a mutual swipe match. Tinder’s VP of Engineering will describe how the service is growing into a global platform for social discovery in many facets of life.

## Helper 

* Your best friend for the day: <href src="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html"><u><font color=blue>Elasticsearch documentation</font></u></href>
* We recommand to use the /goinfre directory for this day as you will need ~3Go for the Elasticsearch cluster. But you are free to do as you whish. Note that using /sgonfre won't work.
* Keep in mind that the /goinfre is a local & temporary directory. So if you change computer you will lose your work, if you log out you might lose your work.
