## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards <href src="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"><u><font color=blue>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</font></u></href>
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  <href src="https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues"><u><font color=blue>https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues</font></u></href>.

## Foreword

Did you know that Elasticsearch helps you find your soulmate (or ONS...) ?
<p>
With more than 26 million swipes daily, Tinder connects more people one-on-one and in real time than any other mobile app in the world. Behind the minimalist UI and elegant “swipe right, swipe left” that Tinder pioneered are tremendous challenges of data science, machine learning, and global scalability.

Hear how Tinder relies on the Elastic Stack to analyze, visualize, and predict not only a) which people a user will swipe right on, or b) which people will swipe right on that user, but c) when there’s a mutual swipe match. Tinder’s VP of Engineering will describe how the service is growing into a global platform for social discovery in many facets of life.
