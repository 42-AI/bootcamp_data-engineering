1 - Run the ./create-doc.sh file
You should a response from the cluster as follow: (id might be different)
{
  "_index" : "twitter",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "V_CNj28BAAu_Qa2cERlN",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
{
  "_index" : "twitter",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "WPCNj28BAAu_Qa2cEhnU",
  "_version" : 1,
  "result" : "created",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 1,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}

2 - Ask the student to start Kibana 
3 - Copy the content of ex01-rendu.txt and paste it into Kibana dev tool
4 - Run the two command for the 'CREATE' part in Kibana and check that the document is well created (similar response as question 1)
6 - Run the commands for the 'READ' part and for each check that you get the same number of hits as ask in the subject
7 - Run the command for the 'UPDATE' part. You should have a similar answer to this:
{
  "_index" : "twitter",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "1",
  "_version" : 2,
  "result" : "updated",
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "_seq_no" : 4,
  "_primary_term" : 1
}
Check that "_version" is 2
Run `GET twitter/_doc/1` and check the content of the message is as asked in the subject

8 - Run the following command in Kibana:
POST _bulk
{"index": {"_index": "test_delete", "_id":1}}
{"name": "clark kent", "aka": "superman"}
{"index": {"_index": "test_delete"}}
{"name": "louis XV", "aka": "le bien aim√©"}
Then run the first command of the 'DELETE' part. Check that the document with id 1 is well deleted by running `GET twitter/_doc/1`. You should get:
{
  "_index" : "test_delete",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "1",
  "found" : false
}
Then run the second command in the 'DELETE' part and check the index 'test_delete' no longer exists in the cluster: `GET _cat/indices?v`
