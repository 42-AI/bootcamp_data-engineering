|   Turnin directory :    |  ex02              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  ex02-rendu.txt    |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None              |
|   Remarks :             |  you have to put all the request you run in Kibana in ex02-rendu.txt |

We lied to you a bit, it's not really the first time you create a mapping. You created an index and mapping and a lot more in the previous excercise. Indeed by default Elasticsearch will infer the mapping from the document and create the mapping for you.  
  
Let's remember one of the documents from the last question.   

```
{
    "user" : "popol",
    "post_date" : "02 12 2015",
    "message" : "trying out Elasticsearch"
}
```

- Your goal is now to make the following request works and return the good result:
```
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "post_date": {
        "gte": "01 01 2016"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Try it on the current twitter index. What do you think about the resutls ?  
To make it works you will have to (put all the request you run in Kibana in ex02-rendu.txt):  

- Write a request to get the current mapping of the twitter index. Find what is wrong in this mapping. 
- Copy the mapping of the `twitter` index and modify it to create a new index named `twitter_better_mapping` with the correct mapping.  
- Re-index the elements in the index `twitter` to the new index named `twitter_better_mapping`  
NB: be smart and use the reindex function see Elastic Doc
