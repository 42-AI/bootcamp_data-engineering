# Exercise 02 - Your first Index Your first Mapping.

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turnin directory :    |  ex02              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  ex02-rendu.txt    |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None              |
|   Remarks :             |  you have to put all the request you run in Kibana in ex02-rendu.txt |

At this point you should have 4 documents in your twitter index from the previous exercise. You are now going to learn about the mapping.  
Doing NoSQL doesn't mean you should not structure your data. When you want to optimize your cluster you must define the mapping of your index, we will see why. You have noticed that in the previous exercise, when you create a document, Elasticsearch automatically created the index for you. Well it also create a default mapping for this index.  
However the default mapping is usually not ideal.

We would like to retrieve all the tweets posted in 2016 and beyond. Try the follwing query:
```
GET twitter/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "post_date": {
        "gte": "01 01 2016"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Do you have the good results ? No... there is a mapping issue.

Your objective now is to create a new index called 'twitter_better_mapping' that contains the same 4 documents as the 'twitter' index but with a mapping that comply with the following rules:
- The following query should only return the tweet post in 2016 and beyond (2 hits):
```
GET twitter_better_mapping/_search
{
  "query": {
    "range": {
      "post_date": {
        "gte": "01 01 2016"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
- The following query should return only 1 hit
```
GET twitter_better_mapping/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "user": "mimich"
    }
  }
}
```
- The mapping must be strict (if you try to index document with field not defined in the mapping, you get an error)
- The size of the twitter_better_mapping should be less than 5 kb.
  
Hint:  
- You can't modify the mapping of an existing index, so you have to create a new one.  
- The easiest way to write a mapping is to start from the default mapping Elasticsearch create. Index a document sample into a temporay index, retrieve the default mapping of this index and copy and modify it to create a new index. Here you already have an index with a default mapping. Write a request to get this mapping and start from here.  
- Once you have create the new index with a better mapping, you index the document manually as you did in previous exercise or you can use the reindex API (see Elastic Doc)
