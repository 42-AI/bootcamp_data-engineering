1- Copy the query from ex05-rendu.txt into Kibana and run the request.  

Check the "Primary Genre" of the top hits (at least top 5) is game.
Then check that the result is somehow relevant to what the user is searching : 
"I'm looking for a game. I'm a big fan of starcraft and I like real time strategy. Can you write a query to find me a game (and I will only accept game) ?"
