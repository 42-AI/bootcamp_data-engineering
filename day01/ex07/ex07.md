Elasticsearch was initially designed for full-text search, so let's try it.

- I'm looking for a game (and no other genre will be accepted). I'm a big fan of starcraft and I like real-time strategy. Can you write a query to find me a game? 

It's a good time to look at how Elasticsearch scores the documents so you can tune your query to increase the result relevance.

There isn't one good answer to this exercise, many answers are possible. Just make sure the top hits you got are relevant to what I'm searching for!
