Elasticsearch was initially designed for full text search, so let's try this.

I'm looking for a game. I'm a big fan of starcraft and I like real time strategy. Can you write a query to find me a game (and I will only accept game) ? 

It's a good time to look at how Elasticsearch scores the documents so you can tune you query to increase the result relevance.

There isn't one good answer for this exercise, many answer are possible. Just make sure the top hits you got are relevant to what I'm searching for!
