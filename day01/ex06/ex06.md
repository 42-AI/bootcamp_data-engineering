We are looking for the Name and Language of games between 5 and 10 euros.

- Write a query that returns the games matching this criterion.

Your query shall filter the "_source_" to return the following fields only: "Name", "Languages", "Price".  


You should get 192 hits.


### Hints

- You might need to adjust the mapping of your index
- Create a new index and use the reindex API to change the mapping rather than using logstash to re-ingest the CSV.
