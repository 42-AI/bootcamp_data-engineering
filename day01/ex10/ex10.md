We will now explore a little Kibana.

Your goal is to create a Dashboard with the following visualization :
- A plot showing the number of game release (Y axis) over the time (X axis)
- An histogram that count the number of game release each year, and for each year the a count of the "average user rating" by interval of 1
- A Pie Chart showing the repartition of Primary Genre
- A cloud of words showing the top developers

Once your dashboard is created, explore the possibilies of Kibana (click on the top developer in the cloud of words for instance)  

Your Dashboard should look something like this :

Hint: you need to create a index pattern first (Go in the management menu, then index pattern)
Hint2: Create each visualitation in the visualization tab and then create the dashboard in the dashboard tab
