# Exercise 00 - The setup.

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turnin directory :    |  ex00              |
|   Files to turn in :    |   |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None              |
|   Remarks :             |  n/a               |

Let's start simple:

* Download and install Elasticsearch. 
Go to <href src="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases"><u><font color="blue">https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases</font></u></href>
In the product filter select 'Elasticsearch'
Choose the version 7.5 and download the tar.gz file 
* Unzip the file
* You should have several directories:
|                        |                     |
| ----------------------:| ------------------- |
| /bin    | Binary scripts including elasticsearch to start a node and elasticsearch-plugin to install plugins |
| /config | Configuration files including elasticsearch.yml                                                    |
| /data   | The location of the data files of each index and shard allocated on the node |
| /jdk    | The bundled version of OpenJDK from the JDK maintainers (GPLv2+CE) |
| /lib    | The Java JAR files of Elasticsearch |
| /logs   | Elasticsearch log files location |
| /modules | Contains various Elasticsearch modules |
| /plugins | Plugin files location. Each plugin will be contained in a subdirectory |

* Start your cluster by running the ./elasticsearch in the /bin folder and wait a few second for the node to start. 

Ok so now your cluster should be running and listening on http://localhost:9200.
Elasticsearch works with a REST API, which means that to query your cluster you just have to send an HTTP request to the good end points. (We will come to that)

For now run
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

You should see something like this:
```py
{
  "name" : "e3r4p23.42.fr",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "SZdgmzxFSnW2IMVxvVj-9w",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.5.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "e9ccaed468e2fac2275a3761849cbee64b39519f",
    "build_date" : "2019-11-26T01:06:52.518245Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.3.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```
If not, feel free to look at the doc :) (or ask your neighbours, or goolge...) <href src="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html"><u><font color="blue">See documentation</font></u></href>

Now stop the cluster.
Change the configuration so that your cluster name is : "my-cluster" and the node name is : "node1"
Restart your cluster and check the new names with 
```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```
