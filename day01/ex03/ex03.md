So by now you already know that mapping a field as a keyword or as a text make a big difference. This is because Elasticsearch analyses all the text fields at ingest so the text easier to search. 
Let's see an example. Ingest the two following documents in an index named school.

```bash
POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "42",
  "text" : "42 is a school where you write a lot of programs"
}

POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "ICART",
  "text" : "The school of art management and art market management"
}
```

We created an index that contains random schools, let's look for programming schools in it.  
Try this request.

```bash
GET school/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

No results... and yet, you have probably noticed that there is a document talking about a famous progamming school.
it's a shame that we can't get it when we execute our request using the keyword programming.

Your mission is to rectify to this! Modify the shoold index mapping to create a shool_bis index that return the good result to the following query:

```bash
GET school_bis/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

Hint:  
- Look for text analyzer in the documention.
- There is a key notion to understand Elasticsearch: the **inverted index**. Take the time to understand how the analyser creates **token** and how this works with the inverted index.
