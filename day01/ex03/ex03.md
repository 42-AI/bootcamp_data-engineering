Elasticsearch assumes that a text must be analyzed before it can be used.
Let's ingest this docuements in index school.

```bash
POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "42",
  "text" : "42 is a school where you write a lot of programs"
}

POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "ICART",
  "text" : "The school of art management and art market management"
}
```

Here we have an index that contains schools, let's look for programming schools in it
Try this request.

```bash
GET school/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

No results, you have probably noticed that there is a document that talks about the famous 42 school, and as we all know the 42 school is the best school of programming,
it's a shame that we can't get it when we execute our request using the keyword programming.

So Elastic allows us to get this document even if our keyword doesn't exactly match a word in the document.
Reindex the data in a new index [school_bis] so we can have this document with this request.

```bash
GET school_bis/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text.analyzer": "programming"
     }
  }
}```
