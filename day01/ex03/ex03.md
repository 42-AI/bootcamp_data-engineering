So by now you already know that mapping a field as a keyword or as a text make a big difference. This is because Elasticsearch analyses all text field at ingest to pre-process the data and make it easier to search. 
Let's see an example. Ingest the two following docuements in an index named school.

```bash
POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "42",
  "text" : "42 is a school where you write a lot of programs"
}

POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "ICART",
  "text" : "The school of art management and art market management"
}
```

Here we have an index that contains schools, let's look for programming schools in it
Try this request.

```bash
GET school/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

No results... and yet, you have probably noticed that there is a document talking about a famous progamming school.
it's a shame that we can't get it when we execute our request using the keyword programming.

Modify the shoold index mapping to create a shool_bis index that return the good result to the following query:

```bash
GET school_bis/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

Hint:  
- Look for text analyzer in the documention.
