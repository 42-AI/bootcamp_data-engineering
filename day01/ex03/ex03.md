So by now you already know that mapping a field as a keyword or as a text makes a big difference. This is because Elasticsearch analyses all the text fields at ingestion so the text is easier to search. 

- Let's see an example. Ingest the two following documents in an index named school.

```
POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "42",
  "text" : "42 is a school where you write a lot of programs"
}

POST school/_doc
{
  "school": "ICART",
  "text" : "The school of art management and art market management"
}
```

We created an index that contains random schools. Let's look for programming schools in it.  


- Try this request.

```
GET school/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

No results... and yet, you have probably noticed that there is a document talking about a famous programming school.
It's a shame that we can't get it when we execute our request using the keyword `programming`.


- Your mission is to rectify this! Modify the school index mapping to create a shool_bis index that returns the good result to the following query:

```
GET school_bis/_search
{
  "query": 
  {
     "match": {
       "text": "programming"
     }
  }
}
```

### Hints

- Look for the text analyzer section in the documentation.
- There is a key notion to understand Elasticsearch: the **inverted index**. Take the time to understand how the analyzer creates **token** and how this works with the inverted index.
