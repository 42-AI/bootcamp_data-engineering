We would like to know what is the most represented game "Genre" (top 10) and for each of those "genre" the repartition of the "Average User Rating" with a bucket interval of one (ie: for each Genre the number of game with an Avg User Rating of 1, of 2, 3, 4, and 5).  
This must be done in a single query.
