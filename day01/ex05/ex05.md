Let's start with a query you already did for the SQL day. Remember Ex07 ?  

We are looking for developers involved in games released before 01/08/2008 included and update after 01/01/2018 included.
Write a query that returns the games matching this criteria.
Your query shall also filter the "_source" to only returns the following fields: "Developer", "Original Release Date", "Current Version Release Date".

Hint1: You might need to adjust the mapping of your index 
Hint2: Create a new index and use the reindex API to change the mapping rather than using logstash to re ingest the csv
Hint3: "bool" query will be useful ;)
