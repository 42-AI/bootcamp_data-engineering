Let's start with some queries you already did for the SQL day.

We are looking for developers involved in games released before 01/08/2008 included and updated after 01/01/2018 included.

- Write a query that returns the games matching this criterion.

Your query shall also filter the "_source" to only return the following fields: `Developer`, `Original Release Date`, `Current Version Release Date`.

You should get 3 hits.


### Hints

- You might need to adjust the mapping of your index
- Create a new index and use the reindex API to change the mapping rather than using logstash to re-ingest the CSV
- The "bool" query will be useful ;)
