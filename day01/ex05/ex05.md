Let's start with some queries you already did for the SQL day.

This one is from Day01 Ex07.  

We are looking for developers involved in games released before 01/08/2008 included and updated after 01/01/2018 included.
Write a query that returns the games matching this criterion.
Your query shall also filter the "_source" to only return the following fields: "Developer", "Original Release Date", "Current Version Release Date".

You should 3 hits.

Hint1: You might need to adjust the mapping of your index   
Hint2: Create a new index and use the reindex API to change the mapping rather than using logstash to re-ingest the CSV  
Hint3: "bool" query will be useful ;)
