# Day03 - Amazon Web Services

Today, you will learn how to use Amazon Web Services. It is to this day, the main Cloud provider followed by Google cloud platform and Azure (for microsoft).

Amazon Web Services started in 2005 ad now has nearly 2000 services. Do to the large amount of services and the maturity of AWS, it is a better option to start learning to use the Cloud.

## Notions of the day

Create an AWS account, setup a billing alarm, 

The day will be divided into two parts. In the first part will learn to use a tool called terraform which will allows us to deploy/destruct an AWS infrastructure. In the second part of the day, you will learn to use a software development kit (SDK) which will allows to use python to interact with AWS.
