Me and AWS lied to you! You thaught deploying a server was that simple. Well it can be but a huge part of the deployment is hidden. This hidden layer is a default configuration using wizard configuration. The default configuration includes :
- network (VPC, subnets, CIDR blocks)
- network components (routing table, Internet gateway)
- security (NACLS, security groups)

The default configuration allows you to use many services however the default security is open to the internet which is quite bad!

In order to deploy an AWS infrastructure at a production level, we need to handle those layers ourself. As you already know, we are using our free tier. However, if you let your server run for weeks you will have to pay. We want to avoid this possibility. That's why we are going to use a tool to automatically deploy and destroy our infrastructure, Terraform.

Terraform is a tool to deploy infrastructure as code. It can be used for multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, ...). We are going to use it to deploy our own virtual network and servers ...

All potetially critical data **MUST NOT** be deployed using infrastructure as code like terraform. If they are, they may be destroyed accidentaly and you never want that to happen!

## Terraform install

First, download the terraform software for macos.

```
brew install terraform
```

You can now run the `terraform --version`. Terraform is ready!

Terraform is composed of two kind of files:
- `.tfvars` : terraform variables.
- `.tf` : terraform infrastructure description.

access code

variables

project organization (terraform files)

## VPC

create VPC

check on aws console
