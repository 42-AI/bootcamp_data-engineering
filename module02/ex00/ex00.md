In this exercise we are going to setup our account to start working with a cloud provider.

Don't worry! Even if you enter your card number, this module should not cost you anything. First, indeed, AWS as a free tier usage (check if it the case also for your cloud provider) that allows you to use a small amount of AWS resources for free. This will be sufficient enough for what you are going to do today. By the end of the day, you will have to entirely destroy your infrastructure (don't keep things running) !!!

## Exercise

- Create an account on your cloud provider (all the exercise were made using AWS but you can choose another cloud provider).
- Set up a billing alarm linked to your email that will alert you if the cost of your infrastructure exceeds 1\$.
- Create a new administrator user separated from your root account (you will need to use this user for all the exercises). Save the credentials linked to the administrator user into a file called `credentials.csv`.

All the mechanisms we are creating now will ensure your access is secured and will allow you to quickly be alerted if you forgot to destroy your infrastructure.
