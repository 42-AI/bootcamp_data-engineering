|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex04              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  app.py, s3_funcs.py |
|   Forbidden function:   |  None              |

We will continue to work on our Flask API to add new functionalities. This time we will work around file download and upload. In order to upload and download files we are going to use something we already used, presigned urls!

## Exercise

Create a Flask application `app.py` with two more routes:

- **`/download/<filename>`** :
    - **status** : `200`
    - **message** : `Successfully downloaded file '<filename>' on s3 bucket '<bucket_name>'`
    - **content** : presigned url to download file
- **`/upload/<filename>`** :
    - **status** : `200`
    - **message** : `Successfully uploaded file '<filename>' on s3 bucket '<bucket_name>'`
    - **content** : presigned url to upload file

The content you return with your Flask API has to be json formatted. You should use boto3 to interact with the s3 bucket you previously (`module02-...`).
