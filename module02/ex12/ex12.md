Let's finish our infrastructure! With our autoscaling group, we now have 2 instances but we still need to go to our AWS console to search the IP of each EC2 instance which is not convenient!

A solution is to create a load balancer. A load balancer as its name indicates will balance the traffic between EC2 instances (of our autoscaling group here).

## Exercise

Create a security group for your load balancer. It must:
- depend on the vpc you created 
- allow traffic from port 5000

Create a load balancer with:
- a health check on port 5000 every 30 sec and a healthy threshold at 2
- a listener on the port 5000
- the cross-zone load balancing option

In your autoscaling group add your load balancer and a health check type of type `ELB`.

Create a terraform output that will display the DNS name of your load balancer (this output will replace the output ip of the EC2 we had).

You should be able to use the DNS name of your load balancer to call the API now (yes this should work with the ip option you created without any other modifications)! 

After the `terraform apply` finished you probably will have to wait 30 sec - 1 minute before the API is working.

**Do not forget to `terraform destroy` at the end of the module!**
