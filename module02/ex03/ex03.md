Before getting into AWS infrastructure, we are going to discover how to interact with AWS resources using a Python SDK (Software Development Kit) called boto3. We are going to work with a python micro framework called Flask to create an API (a programmatic interface) to interact with your s3 bucket. For now, the API will be built locally to ease the development.

nb: for a simplification of the following exercises we are going to use Flask directly like a development environment. If we wanted a more production-ready application we would add a webserver like Nginx/Apache linked with Gunicorn.

## Exercise

Create a server `app.py` with 3 routes:

- **`/`**
    - **status** : `200`
    - **message** : `Successfully connected to module02 upload/download API`
- **`/list_files`** :
    - **status** : `200`
    - **message** : `Successfully listed files on s3 bucket '<bucket_name>'`
    - **content** : list of files within the s3 bucket
- **`/delete/<filename>`** :
    - **status** : `200`
    - **message** : `Successfully deleted file '<filename>' on s3 bucket '<bucket_name>'`

The content you return with your Flask API has to be json formatted. You should use boto3 to interact with the s3 bucket you previously (`module02-...`).

Create a client `client.py` that will call the API you are creating and show results in a more human readable way. The client must implement two options:

- **`ping`**: call the route `/` of the API and print the message.
- **`list`**: call the route `/list_files` of the API and show the files on the bucket.
- **`delete`**: call the route `/delete/<filename>` of the API and delete a file on the bucket.

The client must also have an IP option to precise the location of the API (the default IP must be defined as `0.0.0.0`).
