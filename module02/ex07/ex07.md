As you already noticed, Flask uses the port 5000. In EC2 all the incoming and outgoing traffic is blocked by default (for security reasons). If we want to interact with our API we will have allow the traffic. In AWS, we can define traffic rules using security groups. The security group will then be associated with an EC2 instance.

## Exercise

Create a security that will allow:
- `ssh` incoming traffic (we will use it in the next exercise)
- `tcp` incoming traffic on port `5000` (to interact with our Flask API)
- outgoing traffic to the whole internet

To test the security group you can associate it to a newly created EC2 instance (you will need to use an existing key pair).
