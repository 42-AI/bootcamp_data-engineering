Our API is finished but it is not quite convenient to request! To ease the use of this API, we are going to create a client that will allow us to interact more easily with the API.

## Exercise

Create a client `client.py` that will call the API you are creating and show results in a more human readable way. The client will have two parameters:

- **`--ip`**: IP address of the API (the default IP must be defined as `0.0.0.0`)
- **`--filename`**: file name to delete, download or upload. 

... and the following options:

- **`ping`**: call the route `/` of the API and print the message.
- **`list`**: call the route `/list_files` of the API and show the files on the bucket.
- **`delete`**: call the route `/delete/<filename>` of the API and delete a file on the bucket.
- **`download`**: call the route `/download/<filename>` of the API and download a file from the bucket.
- **`upload`**: call the route `/delete/<filename>` of the API and upload a file on the bucket.
