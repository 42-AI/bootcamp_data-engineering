**Objective:**

You must clean the given csv dataset in order to insert it into a postgreSQL table.

**Instructions:**

You first need to download the appstore_games data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games/download).

We are going to keep the following columns: `ID`, `Name`, `Average User Rating`, `User Rating Count`, `Price`, `Description`, `Developer`, `Age Rating`, `Languages`, `Size`, `Primary Genre`, `Genres`, `Original Release Date`, `Current Version Release Date`.

1) You need to implement the function `df_nan_filter`. It takes a pandas dataframe as input and applies the following replacement for NaN values :

* remove the row if `Size` if NaN
* set `Languages` as "EN" if NaN
* set `Price` as 0.0 if NaN
* set `Average User Rating` as median of the column if NaN
* set `User Rating Count` as 1 if NaN

```python
def df_nan_filter(df):
    """Apply filters on NaN values 
    Args:
      df: pandas dataframe.
    Returns:
      Filtered Dataframe.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

2) Create the function `change_date_format` that will change the date format from `dd/mm/yy` to `yy-mm-dd`
```python
def change_date_format(date: str):
    """Change date format from dd/mm/yy to yy-mm-dd
    Args:
      date: a string representing the date.
    Returns:
      The date in the format yy-mm-dd.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

Your function must work with the following commands

```python
df["Original Release Date"] = df["Original Release Date"].apply(lambda x: change_date_format(x))
df["Current Version Release Date"] = df["Current Version Release Date"].apply(lambda x: change_date_format(x))
```

3) You need to apply the following function to every column of your dataset (using a for loop).

```python
import ast

def string_filter(s: str):
    """Apply filters in order to clean the string.
    Args:
      s: string.
    Returns:
      Filtered String.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
    s = ast.literal_eval("b'''%s'''" % s)
    s = s.decode('raw_unicode_escape').encode('ascii', 'ignore')
    s = re.sub('[\t\n\r\v\f]', ' ', s.decode())
    s = re.sub(' +', ' ', s)
    s = s.strip('"')
    return (s)
```

4) Lastly, convert the data type of the columns `Age Rating`, `User Rating Count` and `Size` to int. 

You must apply this 4 steps in order to create the file `appstore_games.cleaned.csv`.

## Examples

The following example does not show the true dataset and values obtained after the filters.
```python
>>> df = pd.read_csv("appstore_games.csv")
>>> df.head(1)
       Average User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
1                  NaN                NaN    NaN        NaN
>>> df = nan_filter(df)
>>> df.head(1)
Age User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
              4                  3      1        EN
```

```python
for e in df:
    print(e, df.loc[0, e])
```
With the above code, you should obtain something similar to this output for the values of the first row.
