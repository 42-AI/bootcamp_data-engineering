## Objective

You must clean the given CSV dataset to insert it into a PostgreSQL table.

## Instructions

The `appstore_games.csv` file is available in the resources.

We are going to keep the following columns: `ID`, `Name`, `Average User Rating`, `User Rating Count`, `Price`, `Description`, `Developer`, `Age Rating`, `Languages`, `Size`, `Primary Genre`, `Genres`, `Original Release Date`, `Current Version Release Date`.

1) You need to implement the function `df_nan_filter`. It takes a pandas dataframe as input and applies the following replacement for NaN values :

* remove the row if `Size` if NaN.
* set `Languages` as "EN" if NaN.
* set `Price` as 0.0 if NaN.
* set `Average User Rating` as the median of the column if NaN.
* set `User Rating Count` as 1 if NaN.

```python
def df_nan_filter(df):
    """Apply filters on NaN values 
    Args:
      df: pandas dataframe.
    Returns:
      Filtered Dataframe.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

1) Create the function `change_date_format` that will change the date format from `dd/mm/yyyy` to `yyyy-mm-dd`.

```python
def change_date_format(date: str):
    """Change date format from dd/mm/yyyy to yyyy-mm-dd
    Args:
      date: a string representing the date.
    Returns:
      The date in the format yyyy-mm-dd.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

Your function must work with the following commands.

```python
df["Original Release Date"] = df["Original Release Date"].apply(lambda x: change_date_format(x))
df["Current Version Release Date"] = df["Current Version Release Date"].apply(lambda x: change_date_format(x))
```

3) You need to apply the following function to the `Description` column.

```python
import re

def string_filter(s: str):
    """Apply filters in order to clean the string.
    Args:
      s: string.
    Returns:
      Filtered String.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
    # filter : \\t, \\n, \\U1a1b2c3d4, \\u1a2b, \\x1a
    # turn \' into '
    # replace remaining \\ with \
    # turn multiple spaces into one space
    s = re.sub(r'''\\+(t|n|U[a-z0-9]{8}|u[a-z0-9]{4}|x[a-z0-9]{2}|[\.]{2})''', ' ', s)
    s = s.replace('\\\'', '\'').replace('\\\\', '\\')
    s = re.sub(r' +', ' ', s)
    return (s)
```

4) Remove the `ID` duplicates.

5) Convert the data type of the columns `Age Rating`, `User Rating Count` and `Size` to int.

6) Remove the rows with a `Name` length below 4 characters. 

You must apply these steps to create a script producing the file `appstore_games.cleaned.csv`.

## Examples

The following example does not show the true dataset and values obtained after the filters.
```python
>>> df = pd.read_csv("appstore_games.csv")
>>> df.head(1)
       Average User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
1                  NaN                NaN    NaN        NaN
>>> df = nan_filter(df)
>>> df.head(1)
Age User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
              4                  1     15        EN
```

```python
for e in df:
    print("'{}' :: {}".format(e, df.loc[0, e]))
```
With the above code, you should obtain something similar to this output for the values of the first row. The output shape is (16809, 14).
