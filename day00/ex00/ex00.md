## PostgreSQL intall

The first thing we need to do is install PostgreSQL.
```zsh
brew install postgresql
```
nb: if you notice any problem with brew, you can reinstall it  with the following command.
```zsh
rm -rf $HOME/.brew && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew $HOME/.brew && echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.brew/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc && brew update
```

The next thing we need to do is export a variable `PGDATA`. We can add the folowing line to our `.zshrc` file
```zsh
export PGDATA=$HOME/.brew/var/postgres
```
and source the .zshrc.
```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
Now, we can start the postgresql server. A server is a program running in background wich manages the access to a specific resource, service or network. As you guessed, the postgresql allows us to access a database here.

We can start the server.
```zsh
$> pg_ctl start
waiting for server to start....2019-12-08 15:58:21.171 CET [84406] LOG:  starting PostgreSQL 12.1 on x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4), 64-bit

 done
server started
```
We notice the postgreSQL is associated with the port `5432`.

A server program is often associated with a client. Our client here is called `psql`. At the beginning only one database exists, `postgres`. We must use that database first to access postgresql console.
```postgresql
$> psql -d postgres
psql (12.1)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```
`\?` allows you to see all the possible commands in the postgresql console.
The first thing we can do is list the databases with `\l`.
```postgresql
postgres=# \l
                          List of databases
   Name    | Owner  | Encoding | Collate | Ctype | Access privileges
-----------+--------+----------+---------+-------+-------------------
 postgres  | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     |
 template0 | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/fbabin        +
           |        |          |         |       | fbabin=CTc/fbabin
 template1 | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/fbabin        +
           |        |          |         |       | fbabin=CTc/fbabin
(3 rows)
```

We are going to create a database for the day.
```postgresql
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE appstore_games;
```
Add a user with a very strong password !
```postgresql
postgres=# CREATE USER postgres_user WITH PASSWORD '12345';
```
We must alter the database (changes the attributes of a database) in order to allow access only for us.
```postgresql
postgres=# ALTER DATABASE appstore_games OWNER TO postgres_user;
```
The last thing we need to do is edit `~/.brew/var/postgres/pg_hba.conf` file in order to modify the following line.
```
host	all		all		127.0.0.1/32		trusted
```
to
```
host	all		all		127.0.0.1/32		md5
```
This modification will force the use of the password in order to connect to the database. 

## Conda manual install

If you want a fully automated install go to [Automated install](#automated) part. The automated part will allow you to reinstall everything more easily if you change of Desktop. Here, we are going to see a step by step install.

1. Download conda install with the following command (MacOS version).
```zsh
curl -LO "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
```
2. Install conda with the script (we advise you to install it with this path `/goinfre/miniconda3`).
```zsh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p <path>
```
The goinfre will change depending on your desktop location in cluster, so you will need to reinstall everything.

3. Install needed requirements.
```zsh
conda install -y "jupyter" "numpy" "pandas" "psycopg2"
```
4. Add export to your `.zshrc` file.
```zsh
export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH:$PATH
```
5. Source your `.zshrc` file.
```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
6. Check your python environment.
```zsh
which python
```
Your python should now be the one corresponding to the miniconda environment ! 

<div id='automated'/></div>

## Conda automated install 

A way to install the entire environment is to define a bash function in your `~/.zshrc`.

1. Copy paste the following code into your `~/.zshrc`.

```zsh
function set_conda {
    HOME=$(echo ~)
    INSTALL_PATH="/goinfre"
    MINICONDA_PATH=$INSTALL_PATH"/miniconda3/bin"
    PYTHON_PATH=$(which python)
    SCRIPT="Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
    REQUIREMENTS="jupyter numpy pandas psycopg2"
    DL_LINK="https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"

    if echo $PYTHON_PATH | grep -q $INSTALL_PATH; then
	    echo "good python version :)"
    else
	cd
	if [ ! -f $SCRIPT ]; then
		curl -LO $DL_LINK
    	fi
    	if [ ! -d $MINICONDA_PATH ]; then
	    	sh $SCRIPT -b -p $INSTALL_PATH"/miniconda3"
	fi
	conda install -y $(echo $REQUIREMENTS)
	clear
	echo "Which python:"
	which python
	if grep -q "^export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH" ~/.zshrc
	then
		echo "export already in .zshrc";
	else
		echo "adding export to .zshrc ...";
		echo "export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
	fi
	source ~/.zshrc
    fi
}
```

By default, conda will be installed in the goinfre (look at the `INSTALL_PATH` variable). Feel free to change that path if you want.

The function can be used whenever we want and will install miniconda and all needed librairies for the day. It will also add a line to export miniconda environment.

2. Source your `.zshrc` with the following command.
```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
3. Use the function `set_conda`. 
```zsh
set_conda
```
When the installation is done rerun the `set_conda` function.

4. Check python path
```zsh
which python
```
Your python should now be the one corresponding to the miniconda environment !
