## The client-server architecture

PostgreSQL is an open-source database wich follows a client-server architecture. It is divided in three different components :
- a **client**, a program on the user's machine which communicates the user's query to the server and receives the server's answers. 
- a **server**, a program running in the background that manages access to a specific resource, service or network. The server will understand the client's query and apply it to the database. Then it will send an answer to the client.
- a **database system**, where the data is stored.

ps: client and server can be located on the same machine

In the case of PostgreSQL, we are going to use `psql` as a client and `pg_ctl` for the server.

## PostgreSQL install

The first thing we need to do is install PostgreSQL.

```bash
brew install postgresql
```

nb: if you notice any problem with brew, you can reinstall it with the following command.

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/.brew && git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew $HOME/.brew && echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.brew/bin:$PATH' >> $HOME/.zshrc && source $HOME/.zshrc && brew update
```

The next thing we need to do is export a variable `PGDATA`. We can add the following line to our `.zshrc` file.

```bash
export PGDATA=$HOME/.brew/var/postgres
```

and source the .zshrc.

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, we can start the postgresql server. A server is a program running in the background that manages access to a specific resource, service or network. As you guessed, the postgresql allows us to access a database here.

We can start the server.

```bash
$> pg_ctl start
waiting for server to start....2019-12-08 15:58:21.171 CET [84406] LOG:  starting PostgreSQL 12.1 on x86_64-apple-darwin18.6.0, compiled by Apple LLVM version 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4), 64-bit

 done
server started
```

We notice the postgreSQL is associated with the port `5432`.

`pg_ctl stop` can stop the server.

A server program is often associated with a client. Our client here is called `psql`. In the beginning, only one database exists, `postgres`. We must use that database first to access the postgresql console.

```bash
$> psql -d postgres
psql (12.1)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```

`\?` allows you to see all the possible commands in the PostgreSQL console.
The first thing we can do is list the databases with `\l`.

```txt
postgres=# \l
                          List of databases
   Name    | Owner  | Encoding | Collate | Ctype | Access privileges
-----------+--------+----------+---------+-------+-------------------
 postgres  | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     |
 template0 | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/fbabin        +
           |        |          |         |       | fbabin=CTc/fbabin
 template1 | fbabin | UTF8     | C       | C     | =c/fbabin        +
           |        |          |         |       | fbabin=CTc/fbabin
(3 rows)
```

We are going to create a database for the day.
```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE appstore_games;
```
Add a user with a very strong password!
```bash
postgres=# CREATE USER postgres_user WITH PASSWORD '12345';
```
We must alter the database (changes the attributes of a database) to allow access only for us.
```bash
postgres=# ALTER DATABASE appstore_games OWNER TO postgres_user;
```
The last thing we need to do is edit the `~/.brew/var/postgres/pg_hba.conf` file to modify the following line.
```
host	all		all		127.0.0.1/32		trusted
```
to
```
host	all		all		127.0.0.1/32		md5
```
This modification will force the use of the password to connect to the database. 

We are ready to use Postgres!

## Pyenv install

Dealing with Python is often hell when it comes to python versions and librairies version. This problem is often encountered few people are working on the same server with different library needs.
Furthermore you don't want to mess with the system python. That's why virtual environments and separated python are a prefered solution.

You can install pyenv with brew using the following command.

```txt
brew install pyenv
```

All the python candidates can then be listed.

```txt
pyenv install --list | grep " 3\.[678]"
```
... and installed. For the day we are going to choose version `3.8.0`.

```txt
pyenv install -v 3.8.0
```

Finally the installed version can be activated through this command.

```txt
pyenv global 3.8.0
```

Donâ€™t forget to add those lines to your .zshrc file in order to activate your python environment each time you open a terminal.

```txt
export PATH="/home/misteir/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

pyenv global 3.8.0 #activate the python 3.8.0 as default python
```

## Pipenv install

Pipenv is a tool to handle packages versions of an environment. This tool is very similar to the `requirements.txt` file with some extra metadata.

Pipenv can be installed with this simple command.

```txt
pip install pipenv
```

You can find a toml file for the day named `Pipfile`.

```txt
[[source]]
url = "https://pypi.python.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true
name = "pypi"

[packages]
jupyter = "*"
numpy = "*"
pandas = "*"
psycopg2 = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.8.0"
```

To setup your environment just follow these two steps.

```txt
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

You have now PostgreSQL, virtual python and requirements installed and ready for the day!
