**Objective:**

You must clean the given csv dataset in order to insert it into a postgreSQL table.

**Instructions:**

You first need to download the appstore_games data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games/download).

We are going to keep the following columns: "ID", "Name", "Average User Rating", "User Rating Count", "Price", "Description", "Developer", "Age Rating", "Languages", "Size", "Primary Genre", "Genres", "Original Release Date", "Current Version Release Date".

The first function you need to implement is `df_nan_filter`. It takes a pandas dataframe as input and applies the following replacement for NaN values :
* remove the row if `Size` if NaN
* set `Languages` as "EN" if NaN
* set `Price` as 0.0 if NaN
* set `Average User Rating` as median of the column if NaN
* set `User Rating Count` as 1 if NaN

```python
def df_nan_filter(df):
    """Apply filters on NaN values 
    Args:
      df: pandas dataframe.
    Returns:
      Filtered Dataframe.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

The second function you need to implement is `special_char_filter`. It takes a string dataframe as input and applies the following filter on the string :
* decode unicode chars (this filter is needed to remove `\u202` chars)
* remove leading and trailing quotes (`'"'`) 
* keep only ascii chars

```python
def special_char_filter(s: str):
    """Apply special char filters on string
    Args:
      s: string.
    Returns:
      Filtered String.
    Raises:
      This function shouldn't raise any Exception.
    """
```

You must apply this two functions in order to create the file `filtered_appstore_games.csv`.

**Examples**

The following example does not show the true dataset and values obtained after the filters.
```python
>>> df = pd.read_csv("appstore_games.csv")
>>> df.head(1)
       Average User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
1                  NaN                NaN    NaN        NaN
>>> df = nan_filter(df)
>>> df.head(1)
       Average User Rating  User Rating Count  Price Languages
1                  3.6                1    0.0        EN
>>> special_char_filter("\"Barrels Fun\"")
Barrels O Fun
>>> special_char_filter("MILLIONAIRE TYCOON\u2122")
MILLIONAIRE TYCOON
```
