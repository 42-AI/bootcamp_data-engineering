## Objective

Create a statistically representative sample of your dataset. 

## Instructions

First, you need to compute the representative sample size of your dataset. If you don't know what a statistically representative sample is, look up the Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination). This is very helpful in data analysis as it enables you to run time and memory consuming algorithms on a smaller dataset, but still have statistically representative results. Once you understand what it is, you can either compute the number by hand if you feel like doing the math or use an online sample size calculator. 

Choose a Margin of Error of 5% and a Confidence Level of 95%.

When you have your sample size number, write a query that will allow you to ramdomly pick that number of IDs in your dataset. For example, if you find a sample size of 1000, you will want to randomly pick 1000 IDs in your dataset. 

Hint #1: you can use an SQL sample function 
Hint #2: you can create a table that only contains your randomly picked IDs, and then use a second SQL query to fetch all corresponding rows in your dataset. 

**You must only use PostgreSQL for your queries !**
