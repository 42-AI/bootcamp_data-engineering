## Objective

Give the top 5 most played genres among games that have several distinct languages greater or equal to 3. 

## Instructions

You must write a query that filters games according to the number of languages they have, and then filter out the ones that have strictly less than 3 languages. Then you need to select the top 5 genres where those games appear.

**You must only use PostgreSQL for your queries !**


## Example

```txt
$> python worldwide.py
Strategy
...
```

As you guessed, you should have 5 hits.
