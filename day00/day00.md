# Day00 - SQL with PostgreSQL

Today, you will learn how to use a SQL database: PostgreSQL.

## Notions of the day

The purpose of the day is first to create, administrate and normalize a PostgreSQL Database. Then, we are going to analyse the data and visualize the content of the database. Finally, we will see advanced notions like caching, replication and backups.
