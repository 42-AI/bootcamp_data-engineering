## Objective

Analyze the price distribution of games by plotting the curve distribution. 

## Instructions

First you need to write the right query to output a table where you have the distribution of price, i.e. the number of games for each price. 

Then, you can use matplotlib to look at your curve. Does it seem like the prices follow a Gaussian law? Use "print" in the .py file to answer this question with the format: "gaussian law: yes" or "gaussian law: no".

Finally, you can use numpy to find the mean and the standard deviation of your data set. Use "print" in the .py file to answer this question with the format: "mean = ..." and "std = ...".

**You are allowed to use python's matplotlib library to plot the curve, and numpy to compute the mean and the standard deviation, but under no circumstances should you use python for anything else. Your data should be formatted ONLY with your PostgreSQL query**
