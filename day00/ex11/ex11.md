## Objective

Analyze the price distribution of games by plotting a histogram of the price distribution. 

## Instructions

First, you need to write the right query to output a table where you have the distribution of price, i.e. the number of games for each price. 

Then, you can use matplotlib to create a histogram. Your histogram will have to :
- not show games with a price below 1.0
- have a bar plot with 3 euros interval
- have the xlabel `Price`
- have the ylabel `Frequency`
- have the title `Appstore games price`

You will have to save your histogram in a file named `price.png`

Finally, you have to use numpy to find the mean and the standard deviation of your data set.

nb: you do not need to worry about the number of decimals printed

**You can use PostgreSQL and Python (for numpy, matplotlib, bins creation ...)**


## Example

This answer may not be the right one.

```bash
> python price.py
mean price :  15.04098
std price :  6.03456
```
