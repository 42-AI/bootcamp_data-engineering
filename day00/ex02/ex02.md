## Objective

You must normalize the given csv dataset in order to insert it into a postgreSQL table.

## Instructions

We are going to use the previously cleaned dataset and apply the `1NF normalization` rule to it.

### 1NF normalization
* each column should contain atomic values (list entries like `x, y` violate this rule)
* each column should contain values of the same type
* each column should have unique names
* order in which data is saved does not matter

This rule is normally applied to a database but we are going to use those data as databases tables in the next exercises.

The only rule that we are not actually following concerns the list of values in columns. Not respecting this rule will complicate queries a lot (querying on a list is not convinient).


The two columns that don't respect this rule are `Languages` and `Genres`. In order to respect the 1NF rule you have to create 3 dataframes (that are going to be postgresql tables) :

* **df** : `ID`, `Name`, `Average User Rating`,`User Rating Count`, `Price`, `Description`, `Developer`, `Age Rating`, `Size`, `Original Release Date`, `Current Version Release Date`
* **df_genres** : `ID`, `Primary Genre`, `Genres`
* **df_languages** : `ID`, `Languages`

We want to go from this form ...

```
          ID         Languages
0  284921427        DA, NL, EN
```

... to this one.

```
          ID Languages
0  284921427        DA
1  284921427        NL
2  284921427        EN
```

In order to do that we can use the `explode` function of pandas. This function only works with lists so we have to convert the string `DA, NL, EN` to a list format like `[DA, NL, EN]`.

1) Create the 3 dataframes (with the corresponding columns)

2) Convert multiple words genres to a single word format (ex: `Arcade & Aventure` to `Arcade_&_Aventure`)

3) Convert strings to list format (for columns with list) and remove the 'Games' genre from each list (it is an irrelevant information as it is in each list)

4) Use the `explode` function of pandas (index of dataframes will be broken)
5) reset the index of the dataframes (`reset_index` function)

6) Save the dataframes into the files :
* `appstore_games.normalized.csv`
* `appstore_games_genres.normalized.csv`
* `appstore_games_languages.normalized.csv`

## Examples

```python
>> print(lang_df.head())
          ID  Language
0  284921427        DA
1  284921427        NL
2  284921427        EN
3  284921427        FI
4  284921427        FR
```

```python
>> print(genr_df.head())
          ID Primary Genre     Genre
0  284921427         Games  Strategy
1  284921427         Games    Puzzle
2  284926400         Games     Games
3  284926400         Games  Strategy
```
