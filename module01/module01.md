# Module01 - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana

In the module, you will learn how to use a NoSQL database: Elasticsearch.
Wait... Elasticsearch is a database? Well, not exactly it is more than that. It is defined as a search and analytics engine. But let's keep it simple for now, consider it as a database, we will see the rest later.

## Notions of the module

Create an Elasticsearch cluster, create index and mappings, ingest document, search & aggregate, create visuals with Kibana.  

In the first part of this module (ex00 to ex03) you will learn the basics of Elasticsearch. Then you will apply this to a real dataset.

## General rules

* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask any question in the dedicated channel in Slack: **[42ai slack](https://42-ai.slack.com)**.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  **[Github issues](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_data-engineering/issues)**.

## Foreword

Did you know that Elasticsearch helps you find your soulmate?

With more than 26 million swipes daily, Tinder connects more people one-on-one and in real-time than any other mobile app in the world. Behind the minimalist UI and elegant "swipe right, swipe left" that Tinder pioneered are tremendous challenges of data science, machine learning, and global scalability.

Hear how Tinder relies on the Elastic Stack to analyze, visualize, and predict not only a) which people a user will swipe right on, or b) which people will swipe right on that user, but c) when there's a mutual swipe match. Tinder's VP of Engineering will describe how the service is growing into a global platform for social discovery in many facets of life.

If you wanna know how the magic works: **[elastic tinder](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/conf/2017/sf/tinder-using-the-elastic-stack-to-make-connections-around-the-world)**.

## Helper 

* Your best friend for the module: **[Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)**.
* We recommend using the `/goinfre` directory for this module as you will need ~3Go for the Elasticsearch cluster. But you are free to do as you wish. Note that using `/sgoinfre` won't work.
* Keep in mind that the `/goinfre` is a local & temporary directory. So if you change computer you will lose your work, if you log out you might lose your work.
